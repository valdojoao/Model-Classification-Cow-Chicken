# Model-Classification-Cow-Chicken: 06/2019

This is CNN model for classifying images containing cows and chickens. The dataset consits of 4032 images
sourced from the ImageNet database. 

Training the model on Google Colaboratory GPU took around 45mins, so its highly recommended
while it took around 5h:30mins to train the model on my local a computer without GPU support.

In order to prevent overfitting some techniques such as dropout and data augmentation were implemented.
