# Model-Classification-Cow-Chicken: 06/2019

This is CNN model for classifying images containing cows and chickens. The dataset consits of 4032 images
sourced from the ImageNet database. 

It took around 45mins to train the model on Google Colaboratory GPU while it took around 5h:30mins to train the model on my local computer without GPU support. So its highly recommended to utilize GPUs.

In order to prevent overfitting some techniques such as dropout and data augmentation were implemented.
